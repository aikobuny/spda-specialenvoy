                The Mindanao Railway, previously known as the Trans-Mindanao High Speed Railway, is a proposed inter-city rail system in Mindanao, the southernmost major island of the Philippines. Originally proposed in 1936 as part of Manuel L. Quezon's efforts to strengthen the presence of Commonwealth government in Mindanao against the rising influence of Imperial Japan before World War II, the line was shelved. Other proposals and studies were made in the 1950s, 1990s, and the 2000s, but never materialized. The current line began development in 2018,[1] with construction set to begin in late 2021.[needs update][2] It will be initially built as a single-track standard gauge system to be operated by diesel-powered rolling stock, but will have provisions for upgrading to double-track and electrification through overhead lines.
                <br><br>
                The system will be constructed as a network 1,544 km (959 mi) long in its present form, totalling 2,278 km (1,415 mi) of track, with the centerpiece being a circumferential mainline that connects some of the major cities of the island. An east-west radial mainline shall also be built to the Zamboanga Peninsula, and a number of other radial lines will serve as branch lines. As with other projects of the Philippine National Railways, the Mindanao Railway shall be constructed in phases covering segments of various lengths. The first phase, the Tagum–Digos segment of the circumferential mainline, will be the first section to be constructed. This segment will be partially opened by 2022[needs update], with full operations by 2024. The rest of the 17 segments will be built as part of Phases 2 to 10, with a target completion date between 2032 and 2037.

                1. Davao City to Kibawe, Bukidnon — The length of this segment is 100 km (62 mi).<br>
                2. Cagayan de Oro to Kibawe — The length of this segment is 140 km (87 mi). The route will also pass by Malaybalay.<br>
                3. Cotabato City to Kibawe — The length of this segment is 120 km (75 mi). A branch line would have passed by Parang, Maguindanao.<br>
                4. Nasipit, Agusan del Norte to Santa Josefa, Agusan del Sur — The length of this segment is 120 km (75 mi). A branch line would have passed by Butuan.<br>
                5. Butuan to Surigao City — The length of this segment is 100 km (62 mi).<br>
                6. Davao City to Santa Josefa — The length of this segment is 110 km (68 mi).<br>
                7. Iligan to Kibawe — The length of this segment is 110 km (68 mi). A station would have also been built in the area of Dansalan.<br>
                8. Makar to Midsayap, Cotabato — The length of this segment is 150 km (93 mi). The area referred in this study as Makar is now divided between General Santos and T'Boli, South Cotabato.<br>
                9. Davao City to Makar — The length of this segment is 110 km (68 mi).<br>
                10. Bislig to Santa Josefa — A branch of Segment 4, the length of this segment is 50 km (31 mi).<br>
